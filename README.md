# Interactive-Power-BI-Dashboard-for-Road-Accident-Analysis

Road Accident Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard
Project Overview

This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze road accident trends across various dimensions, providing actionable insights for decision-makers.
The dashboard enables users to explore casualties, accident severity, locations, and contributing factors such as weather and road conditions with dynamic filters and KPIs.

Key Features
Dynamic KPIs: Real-time metrics for total casualties, fatal accidents, and accident trends.
Interactive Filters: Analyze data by weather conditions, road surface conditions, and time period.
Geospatial Analysis: Accident hotspots visualized on an interactive map.
Casualty Breakdown:
By Vehicle Type
By Urban vs. Rural Areas
By Light Conditions (Daylight vs. Dark)
Trend Analysis: Casualties comparison between current year (CY) and previous year (PY).

Data Modeling & DAX
Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query
Data Modeling with relationships for multiple dimensions (Location, Time, Vehicle Type, etc.)
DAX Measures for KPIs, YOY percentage changes, and conditional formatting

Tech Stack
Power BI Desktop for visualization and reporting
DAX for custom measures
Geospatial Mapping for location-based analysis

How to Use
Download the .pbix file from this repository.
Open it in Power BI Desktop (latest version recommended).
Interact with the filters and visuals for insights.
